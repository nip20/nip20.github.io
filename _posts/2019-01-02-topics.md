## Call for Papers

We solicit 6–8 page full papers, 2-4 page new ideas and early results (NIER) papers, and 1 page lightning talk that focus on techniques at the intersection of the three communities HPC, PE, and VIS that either use visualization techniques to display large scale performance data or that develop new visualization or visual analytics methods that help create new insights. We welcome submissions presenting novel and experimental ideas as well as tool descriptions.

Papers must be submitted as a PDF file in the ACM Standard proceedings format, and formatted for 8.5” x 11” (U.S. Letter). The page limits include figures, tables, and references.

Papers will be peer-reviewed by members of the program committee and accepted papers will be published by ACM as part of NIP 2020 proceedings. Accepted papers will also be presented during the workshop as a full paper talk (20 min), NIER paper talk (15 min) or a lightning presentation (10 min).
