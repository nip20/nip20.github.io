# International Workshop on New Interfaces for Programming: Visualization, VR/AR, Arts (NIP’20)
{: .text-blue}

## Scope


Since a long time, interfaces available for programming remain mostly unchanged. Usually, software engineers (SE) interact with IDEs through text-based interfaces displayed on a computer screen. Software visualization (SOFTVIS) researchers investigate the use of visual properties to support software engineering tasks such as programming. Some of these software visualizations have explored the use of VR/AR immersive environments. 

Recently, user studies that analyzed the impact of displaying visualizations in such immersive environments have shown preliminary results of positive effects on developers’ user experience. The inherently artistic value of visualizations can be a reason of boosting user experience, which could lead to an improved user performance.

NIP ’20 aims at gathering experts from (i) the SE community, (ii) the SOFTVIS community, (iii) the VR/AR community, and (iv) the Arts community in order to breed cross-community new interfaces that supporting programming tasks. The workshop aims at providing a forum for researchers and practitioners from these mostly disconnected research communities.
